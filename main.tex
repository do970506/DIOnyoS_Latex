\section{Introduction} 
\noindent\textit{Motivation}\\
\indent Due to the COVID-19, the number of people who drink at home has increased significantly. Wine is one of the most popular drinks for people who drink alone, and wine imports rose 110\% year-on-year in the first half of last year. Thus, the demand for wine cellars also increased. However, there are too much information to enjoy wine, such as the way to store wine, or detailed information of the wines. But services that support people who try to get information of in the wine in Korea are poor. Therefore, our team felt the needs for a service that effectively records and manages the wine that I drink and drank, and further recommends and induces to user to purchase the wine.\\

\noindent\textit{Problem Statement}\\
\indent There are many wine applications such as Vivino. However, there is a limitation that the service is based in a foreign country other than Korea. Currently, it is difficult to find information to better enjoy wine in Korea. Accordingly, the necessity of providing various wine information, wine purchase service, SNS sharing service, etc. to enjoy wine better by linking with the wine cellar to facilitate humidity and temperature control was recognized.\\ 

\noindent\textit{Solution}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Available to manage wine and wine cellar effectively. 
    It is possible to manage users' wines and wine cellar in one
    application. Effective wine management is possible by recommending
    appropriate wine storage methods to users. Once the wine is registered, detailed information can be
    easily offered.
    \item Available to create additional consumption of wine cellar. By recommending new wines based on registered wines, new wines can be made, and even wine cellars can be consumed. B2B business development through collaboration with wine sellers is also possible. By providing a user-friendly SNS sharing service, the promotional effect of LG Wine Cellar can also be expected.\\
\end{enumerate}

\section{Development Environment}
\subsection{Choice of software development platform}
Our team will develop application in the environment of Mac operating system. And our application will run on the iOS environment. We'll use the React-Native framework that can develop Android and IOS applications simultaneously. Therefore, it'll make it easier to develop Android OS applications in the future. Therefore, our team will use to create applications based on the ios platform, and usage of the languages will be React-Native, Java Spring, and MariaDB.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item React-Native\\
    React Native is an open source mobile application framework developed by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web, and UWP, allowing developers to use React in addition to native platform features. React Native has the biggest advantage of being able to create native UI for Android and iOS using JavaScript, and create high-quality UI faster than using XML/Java/Kotlin. In addition, we can quickly check changes or modifications with our eyes, making QA or feedback easier to proceed. 
    \item Spring - JAVA Framework\\
    The Spring Framework is an open source application framework for the Java platform. It is used as a foundation technology for the e-government standard framework recommended for use in the development of web services by public institutions in Korea.
    \item MariaDB\\
    It is necessary to store and manage information about wine cellars, users of wine cellars, wine stored in wine cellars. For this, MariaDB is used. MariaDB is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is based on the same source code as for MySQL and follows the GPL v2 license. It also supports the latest SQL functions such as common table expressions (CTE), window functions, temporary data tables, and JSON functions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software in use}
There are already two existing popular apps that manage and record purchased wine. Vivino was launched in 2010 and has recorded more than 50 million downloads so far and maintains a 4.6 rating in the Google Play Store. As it has been a long time since it was released, it has many users' evaluations and reviews. Cellwine was launched in 2016, recording more than 50,000 downloads, and has a rating of 4.0 points in the Play Store. Both Vivino and CellWine can register wine by taking wine labels and record wine that users have been drinking so far. And users can search for a variety of wines around the world, check the ratings and information of each wine, reviews from other tasters, prices, and recommended foods that goes well with wine. And based on the wines that have been drunk and recorded so far, those two apps also recommend new wines that suit the user. Vivino also has the function to purchase wine from the application.

\section{Architecture design and implementation}
\subsection{Overall Architecture}
\indent For our DIOnyoS application, we have several modules for the whole architecture.
First, we used React-Native for client side. It allows the application to perform several functions and implement designs. Using the application, users can register wines in winecellars and easily lock the winecellars. Also, they can share the informations of wine cellars in their social media.\\
\indent Second, we used Amazon AWS EC2, S3 for deployment, Spring framework for whole back-end section to receive and serve data to front-end section as REST API, and Node.js for running React-Native framework. Entire API server except acquiring wine image file is running on Amazon Web Services EC2 instance, and API server for acquiring wine image file is running on Amazon Web Services S3 instance. Below figure shows overall architecture of the service.These modules are interacting each other in the application.

    \subsubsection{Server}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Server/gradle/wrapper/ \\
        This directory is a collection of services that define what logic to deal with when building the application.
        \item Server/src/main/java/com/dionysos/winecellar/config \\
        This directory is a collection of files to facilitate server request processing. When user initialize the application, then WebConfig.java runs automatically to prepare user’s authentication requests.
        \item Server/src/main/java/com/dionysos/winecellar/domain/auth\\
        This directory is a collection of directories or files to handle user’s authentication requests. This directory is focused on handling authentication or confirmation of user’s token.
        \item Server/src/main/java/com/dionysos/winecellar/domain/member\\
        This directory is a collection of files to handle user request about member(user). ‘Config’ directory discern which requests are sent from client. After analyzation, ‘Service’ directory handles that request by logics that written in files in ‘Service’ directory. If SQL query requires, then files in ‘Dao’ directory create SQL query and send to database.
        \item Server/src/main/java/com/dionysos/winecellar/domain/wine\\
        This directory is a collection of files to handle user requests about wine. First, files from ‘Api’ directory receives the requests from user, and then discern which requests are sent from user. After that, files in ‘Service’ directory handles analyzed requests according to a set routine. If SQL query requires, then files in ‘Dao’ directory create SQL query and send to database. Files in ‘Dto’ create and maintain data objects.
        \item Server/src/main/java/com/dionysos/winecellar/domain/winecellar\\
        This directory is a collection of files to handle user requests about winecellar. First, files from ‘Api’ directory receives the requests from user, and then discern which requests are sent from user.

\subsection{Module 1}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item React Native\\
    We use React Native to develop a wine cellar management application for the Apple device, such as IPhone and IPad. It acts as a connection between the user and the server. It also receives the user’s input value, passes it to the backend and shows the stored value of database. 
    \item Axios\\
    We use Axios module for handling request and response from REST API, such as acquiring information of one's wine cellar and sending the password of wine cellar to enable/disable cellar lock function. Axios is Promise based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. It is used to request data from API server.
    \item React\\
    React Native is based on React. 
    React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. 
\end{enumerate}
    
\section{Use cases}
\subsection{Frontend UI}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item WineCellar Main Page
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item My WineCellar Page\\
        This is a main page of DIOnyoS when the user succeeds in logging in and registers a wine seller. My WineCellar Page shows statement of the physical LG winecellar. Depending on the winecellar model, the number of floors varies. The page shows the images of wine label saved in the application. The title container has two icons, which are Setting and Share. By pressing Setting icon, user goes to the My WineCellar setting page. And By pressing Share icon, user can share the image of winecellar in the Instagram with the hashtag '\#LGwinecellar \#MyWineCellar \#DIOnyoS'.
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Wine Register
            \item Wine Information (Detail)

        Before entering Lock Page, user must set 6-digit password of the wine cellar. The password is encrypted and saved in the server's database.
